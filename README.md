# Micro Goal-Setting and Tracking App

## Project Description
A front-end project designed to help coaching clients track micro goals as a way to achieve massive goals. Created as part of coaching pro-bono clients to empower them by helping them visualize their short-term progress. This simple, user-friendly app allows clients to:
- Enter as many micro goals as needed.
- Mark goals as completed.
- Remove completed goals.

## Technologies Used

- **CSS3**: For styling the interface.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic interactions and functionality.

## Features
- Add new micro goals.
- Mark goals as completed.
- Remove goals from the list.
- Visual feedback for completed tasks.

## Usage

## Best Practices

- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent naming conventions across your project (camelCase for JavaScript variables).
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the app is mobile-friendly by using media queries in CSS.
- **Browser Compatibility**: Test the app in different browsers to ensure compatibility.

## Future Improvements
